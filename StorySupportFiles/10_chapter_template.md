## **I. 10-Chapter Novella Template (For Initial Drafting)**

This 10-Chapter Novella Template is designed to provide a chapter-by-chapter structure that is easy to follow for a novella format. These are some of the key components that set a novella apart from other plot structures:

*   **Length:** Usually smaller, between 15,000-40,000 words. I personally prefer a sweet spot around 20,000. These are small enough to be read in a single sitting, but large enough to still gain emotional depth.
*   **Focus:** Often more focused around a single location.
*   **Limited Scope:** Often focused around a single conflict, theme, or arc. Few, if any, subplots.
*   **Smaller Cast.**
*   **Focused on a single emotional effect.** Novellas are often all about hammering home an important point through emotion.
*   **Usually one point of view.**

Here is our Plot Module for a 10-chapter novella:

---

**Chapter 1: The Hook**
*   Start with a mystery, a question that is provocative and creates an information gap that readers want to fill.
*   See if you could condense this mystery into a single visual image.
*   Introduce the protagonist and the setting.
*   Plant seeds of central conflict or problem.
*   Establish the mood.
*   Have the protagonist do something that makes them compelling (i.e., they are really competent at something, they perform a kind act, they are oppressed, etc.).

**Chapter 2: The Inciting Incident**
*   Something happens that turns the Ordinary World of the protagonist upside down.
*   It is not something that can be resolved on its own.
*   There is a lot of conflict.
*   The protagonist is hesitant to engage, but is forced to by events outside of their control.
*   They are forced to make a choice, one that takes them out of their comfort zone and into the "New World" of uncertainty in order to resolve this problem.

**Chapter 3: The New World**
*   The protagonist is uncomfortable in their new world.
*   They meet allies who might help them in their quest (mentor, side-kick, love interest), although the cast might be a lot leaner than in a novel. One side character is common.
*   More information about the antagonist might be revealed, directly or indirectly.
*   The protagonist may be given information, items, weapons, or other tools that may help them on their journey.
*   There is a lot of tension.

**Chapter 4: The First Pinch Point**
*   The protagonist goes through the first major try/fail cycle to try and achieve their goals.
*   They have an encounter with the antagonist or the forces of the antagonist.
*   They fail but survive, and maybe even learned some lessons that will help them in the future.
*   There may be a revelation that changes everything.
*   The protagonist realizes that they've underestimated the antagonist.
*   The stakes are raised.

**Chapter 5: The Midpoint**
*   Major turning point that transforms the protagonist from reactive to proactive.
*   Builds on the fallout from the First Pinch Point and the revelation.
*   Forces the protagonist to reassess their situation.
*   May be an emotional moment, often deepening relationships with other characters, thereby increasing the stakes.
*   There may be a partial success, a glimmer of hope or small victory that motivates the protagonist to press on.

**Chapter 6: The Second Pinch Point**
*   The protagonist gets ready to try again, this time taking a more proactive approach.
*   They fail again or are interrupted by the antagonist or forces of the antagonist.
*   They suffer another literal or figurative battle with the antagonist, and once again they go through another try/fail cycle. This time the consequences are more severe.
*   There is increased tension and stakes.
*   Good place for a plot twist.

**Chapter 7: The Darkest Moment**
*   The "All is Lost" moment; the protagonist reacts to their greatest setback.
*   The protagonist is forced to confront their greatest flaw or fear.
*   Demonstrates the true cost of the journey.
*   They are at their lowest point; they are ready to give up.
*   We may see the antagonist or forces of the antagonist seem poised to win.

**Chapter 8: Climax Prep**
*   A "pep talk" either by the protagonist themselves, an ally, a revelation or another outside influence, gets the protagonist and their allies going again.
*   They make a plan of attack, even against overwhelming odds.
*   They may gain resources/information that they didn't have previously that will help.
*   The protagonist shows themselves capable of confronting and overcoming their flaw (although they haven't done so fully yet).
*   All plot threads converge.

**Chapter 9: The Climax**
*   The protagonist and potential allies confront the antagonist.
*   Allies may fall behind, leaving the protagonist alone.
*   They once again fail, and the antagonist thinks they have won.
*   The protagonist has a moment of introspection, before gathering their strength and finding a way, however unexpected or improbable, to succeed.
*   The antagonist is defeated.
*   This decisive action resolves the primary conflict.

**Chapter 10: Resolution**
*   Wrap up any loose ends of the story.
*   Show the protagonist and how they've grown.
*   Resolve any key relationships and emotional arcs.
*   End with a powerful final image that encapsulates the theme.
